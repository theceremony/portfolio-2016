    <p>I am an intensely dedicated developer and designer with a passion for interactive. During his agency experience over the past 14 years, he has developed a varied skill set – everything from programming to animation to design – that makes me uniquely able to understand and execute client projects that succeed. Projects that I have directed not only look amazing, they function seamlessly. This attention to every aspect of an experience has given me a track record that speaks for itself.</p>
    <p>I stay on the cutting edge of design and development, and I love to experiment with new forms of interaction using the latest tools and gadgets. Few things bring me as much satisfaction as coming up with a completely new and creative solution to an interactive puzzle, whether it’s the best way to manage a client’s requests, or an algorithm to help an experience run more smoothly.</p>
