    <p>Coca-Cola wanted to thank people who make the world a happier place by bringing together 600 of their customers, fans and employees to star in their own movie. We started by printing each frame of the film on 600 separate t-shirts, which were sent to around the globe with a personalized thank you. The recipients were simply asked to put on a smile, take a photo, and claim their frame in a collective effort to complete the film.  We handled everything from creative collaboration, design, and prototyping to front-end and back-end development of the HTML5 website.</p>
